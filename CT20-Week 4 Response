This week was a little harder than usual... BUT overall, I'm confident in my work now. 
We did a sketch in Blender, which was a little confusing at first because we were going at such a fast pace. The first day, it felt as if I was trying to catch up rather than learn, but after day 2, it started making a bit more sense. So it was quite fun!

Anyways besides that, the readings and everything that I forgot to mention have been quite informative, and overall, this class has gotten a bit less stressful, although we did finally have to create our first project, in which I hope it gets approved. 
I made my own prompt, which was to "Create an interactive sketch that allows the shape and color to change when initiated by a right click from the mouse". At first, I was struggling a bit since I kept missing certain brackets to close off the code, so that took a bit. 
Once I got that figured out, though, the rest was a piece of cake, thankfully. I'm glad these assignments are something I have fun doing rather than being really stressed out, SO THANK YOU PROFESSOR!!! It's always nice to have teachers like this.
