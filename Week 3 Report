For this week's class, I learned a lot more! As of now, it's quite fun, such as when doing things like the balloons dropping or trying to make something we created in the past jump/move around. 
The same thing continues to happen, though, where I typically forget the right words needed. Not only that, but I should definitely start checking my grammar a bit more, as that's what makes coding a little hard for me at times. 
Our project is coming up so I'm excited to see whats in store, as I am ready to get creative. Anyways here's the links to some of the things i've made throughout the week.

https://editor.p5js.org/keapaz/sketches/Xe-awjfzp (Tuesday)-- I was helped with this coding by someone who knows what they are doing. So if it looks advanced, part of it was me while the other part was someone helping.
