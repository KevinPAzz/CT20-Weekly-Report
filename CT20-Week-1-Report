My first report for CT20! For this week, we mainly got to know each other and overall just learn about what the course has to offer. I am quite excited to brush off the dust, because the last time I coded was around 6th grade in my robotics class. 
Based on the readings, I got a sense of what to expect, such as the idea of not being afraid to fail, since coding can be seen as an art in itself. Exhaustion is a sign of giving it your all, which plays a big part in creativity. Anyone can learn and create whatever their imagination desires. 
The idea of p5.js was a little confusing at first, but after finally being able to work with it, it feels a bit easier. Creating shapes and changing the color of the outlines and the shapes themselves really gave me a feel for it. It was quite fun, but I still have a lot to learn. 
Lastly, I'm still a little confused about things like assignments and whatnot. This is my first time using GitHub and Element, so it'll take a bit to get used to, but besides that, I think everything should be fine and hopefully a lot of fun!
