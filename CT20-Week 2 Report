For this week, I was able to learn a lot more, such as how to make different shapes orbit/rotate. Although I am still struggling a bit here and there with the coding itself, in the end, I tend to find the little mistakes and get the job done.
I'm not as advanced as some of the individuals here, but I am starting to get a feel of the class a bit more. Not only that, but the videos are also making the class much more informative (as is the reading). 
Overall, for week 2, I would say this class is quite fun, and I think once I really get the hang of almost everything, creating things will be a piece of cake. 

For Tuesday's class, this is what I created: https://editor.p5js.org/keapaz/sketches/pAW2W9--N

For Thursday's class, this is what I created (not done because I was a little stuck): https://editor.p5js.org/keapaz/sketches/qSxolNmMU
